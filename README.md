# Vendor Ranking Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Vendor Ranking Model to optimize procurement decisions by analyzing vendor performance and cost efficiency. Originally designed for real-world use, this version replicates the methodology using dummy data.

## Features
- Weighted scoring based on performance metrics (e.g., cost, quality, timeliness).
- Automated calculations to identify top-performing vendors.
- Visualizations to aid decision-making.

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Power BI (optional)
- Data cleaning and transformation scripts

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
3. Run the notebook or script in `/src`.
