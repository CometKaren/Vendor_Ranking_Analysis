# Data Dictionary

## Purpose
This data dictionary provides detailed descriptions of the fields used in the Power BI project. It serves as a reference for understanding the structure, calculations, and relationships of the data model.

## Scope
The data dictionary includes details for the `Purchase List` and `Vendor List` tables, including raw data columns and calculated fields.

## Table Relationships
- `Purchase List` is linked to `Vendor List` by the `VendorID` column (one-to-many relationship).
- Each vendor in the `Vendor Table` can have multiple purchase orders in the `Purchase List`.

## Data Sources
- `Purchase List`: Simulated data from Kaggle datasets, representing purchase orders and related details.
  - https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulmelikhmeda/inventory-purchase-sales-analysis-and-optimization/input?select=PurchasesFINAL12312016.csv
- `Vendor Table`: Derived from the `Purchase List` data by aggregating vendor-specific metrics.

## Glossary
- **PO**: Purchase Order.
- **Qty**: Quantity.
- **Rec Days**: Receiving Days; The number of days between the purchase order date and receiving date.
- **Rank**: A numerical value representing the relative performance of vendors.
